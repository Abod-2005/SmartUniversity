## 📌 Project Overview

A **Smart Lab Resource Management System** built in Java that simulates how university labs (AI, Robotics, Cybersecurity) create sessions, handle student resource requests, and enforce system-wide rules.

This project was developed as part of the **Design Patterns Lab** course to demonstrate the correct and meaningful application of three core design patterns.

## 🏗️ Design Patterns Used

### 1. 🏭 Factory Method Pattern
Used to create lab sessions without coupling the client to specific session types.

- `LabSessionFactory` → abstract factory base
- `AILabSessionFactory`, `RoboticsLabSessionFactory`, `CybersecurityLabSessionFactory` → concrete factories
- Each factory creates its own session type without `if/switch` logic
- Adding a new lab type = adding one new factory + one new session class, **no existing code is modified**

### 2. 🔨 Builder Pattern
Used to construct `ResourceRequest` objects that have many optional fields.

- Required fields (`studentId`, `resourceType`) go in the `Builder` constructor
- Optional fields (`duration`, `priority`, `notes`, `softwareRequired`, `supervisorApproval`) are set via chained methods
- Produces **immutable** request objects — all fields are `final`

```java
ResourceRequest req = new ResourceRequest.Builder("S123", "GPU")
        .duration(90)
        .priority(3)
        .notes("Training a transformer model")
        .build();
```

### 3. 🔒 Singleton Pattern
Used to ensure one shared configuration instance across the entire system.

- `LabSystemConfig.getInstance()` — single access point
- Private constructor prevents multiple instantiations
- All components read from the same config (capacity, allowed resources, limits)

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Open the project in **IntelliJ IDEA**
2. Make sure the source root is set to `src/`
3. Run `Main.java`

Or compile manually:
```bash
javac -d out src/core/*.java src/factories/*.java src/sessions/*.java src/Main.java
java -cp out Main
```

## 📐 UML Diagram

The UML class diagram is included in the submission ZIP (`UML Diagram.png`).

---

## 📋 Validation Rules

Every submitted request is checked against 3 rules from the Singleton config:

1. **Resource must be allowed** — rejects unknown resource types (e.g., "Coffee Machine")
2. **Student request limit** — each student can submit at most 3 requests per session
3. **Duration limit** — requests exceeding 120 minutes are rejected
